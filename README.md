# RobotMagic

This repository was created in order to create a solution for a robot with the ability to follow a line and compete against classmates in a race. Although it may sound simple, having a robot race around a line is very challenging. 

Some aspects that were included in our design were:
• Edge-triggered interrupts to detect collisions
• Hardware timer modules to drive motors
• A more robust FSM controller that can overcome obstacles

This design will be evaluated across several different metrics, including:
• Speed – The amount of time it takes for your robot to complete the track
• Computational Efficiency - The amount of memory your design requires
• Power Efficiency – The amount of energy required for your car to operate
